          I do not need a special day like this to say how very much I love you. You are in my thoughts every day, and I cannot think of being without you.

An old song about Valentines says, "You make me happy," and you certainly do. There is nothing about you that I do not love--I love your hair, your voice, your eyes, the sound of your laugh, and especially the way you smile at me.

I am the luckiest person alive to be able to call you my sweetheart, my Valentine.
